# robeats autoplayer
A very simple external autoplayer for [RoBeats](https://www.roblox.com/games/698448212).

## How it works
**IT DOES NOT INJECT INTO ROBLOX, IT SCANS PIXEL BRIGHTNESS.**

It scans a certain area for a change in brightness and clicks when it thinks a note is there.

In theory this could be used for any rythm game but it was specifically made for robeats.

It works best in the default map with white notes (only ones tested).

## Usage
- Place the crosshair at where you want the bot to scan for the notes.
- You can add another crosshair by pressing on the `+` button beside the key and place it abit below the hit points to let it catch notes going too fast.
- Make sure `enabled` is checked.
